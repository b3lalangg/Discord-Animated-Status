## Description

#### International Space Station

- The ISS is a modular space station in low Earth orbit.  It is a multinational collaborative project involving five participating space agencies: NASA (United States), Roscosmos (Russia), JAXA (Japan), ESA (Europe), and CSA (Canada). The ISS was originally intended to be a laboratory, observatory, and factory while providing transportation, maintenance, and a low Earth orbit staging base for possible future missions to the Moon, Mars, and asteroids. However not all of the uses envisioned and now its mainly used to conduct scientific research, with power, data, cooling, and crew available to support experiments. 
- We can check who's inside the ISS and the latitude & longitute by using the [Open Notify API](http://open-notify.org).
